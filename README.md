Standalone implementation. It means that you can put this server wherever you want, even on another machine. You need to setup a project in Actions on Google Console. You find instructions below.

Based on Pawcio's script at [domoticz forum](https://www.domoticz.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=69&t=27244)

Required:
- public url
- python >= 3.5
- Make local deployment available trough HTTPS with valid certificate:
  - Use ngrok for a secure SSL tunnel with valid public HTTPS URL
  - Configure reverse proxy with domain name and valid certificate using Lets Encrypt

Domoticz-Google-Assistant delivers: 
- The oauth authorization and smarthome endpoint for the google assistant.
- Two-factor authentication pin for domoticz protected devices. (works best with english language)
- Acknowledgement with Yes or No. (works best with english language)
- Arm Disarm Securitypanel. (works best with english language)
- On/Off, Brightness, Thermostat, Color Settings, speaker volume, Lock/Unlock, Scene and Open/Close.
- Stream surveillance camera to chromecast.
- Toggle Selector switches.
- Ngrok, instantly create a public HTTPS URL. Don't have to open any port on router and do not require a reverse proxy.

Please feel free to modify it, extend and improve

[Installation and configuration](https://github.com/DewGew/Domoticz-Google-Assistant/wiki)

## RPI/Ubuntu Installation with autostart
This installs the dzga in a virtual enviroment.

Just open a terminal window and execute this command. Thats it!
```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DewGew/dzga-installer/master/install.sh)
```
Start/stop Domoticz-Google-Assistant server:
```bash
sudo systemctl start dzga
sudo systemctl stop dzga
```
Check if service is running:
```bash
sudo systemctl status dzga
```
To update run installer again:
```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DewGew/dzga-installer/master/install.sh)
```
To run manually:
```
cd /home/${USER}/
sudo systemctl stop dzga #If service is running
source Domoticz-Google-Assistant/env/bin/activate
python3 Domoticz-Google-Assistant
```

## Manual Installation
Open a terminal window and execute those commands. NOTE: "${USER}" will automatically take your username. No need to change that. Just copy and paste.
```bash
cd /home/${USER}/
git clone https://github.com/DewGew/Domoticz-Google-Assistant
pip install -r ~/Domoticz-Google-Assistant/requirements/pip-requirements.txt
```
Manual start (stop with 'ctrl-c'):
```bash
cd /home/${USER}/
python3 Domoticz-Google-Assistant
```
Update:
```bash
cd /home/${USER}/Domoticz-Google-Assistant/
git pull
```
## Configuration
You can access the interface via http://localhost:3030/settings. The default username is `admin` and the default password is `admin`.
Configuration and [Actions on Google](https://github.com/DewGew/Domoticz-Google-Assistant/wiki/2.-Setup-Actions-on-Google) must be modified properly.
You can also edit config.yaml in Domoticz-Google-Assistant folder to change the configuration. 
```python
# Configuration:
port_number: 3030

# Instantly create a public HTTPS URL. Don't have to open any port on router and do not require a reverse proxy.
# When ngrok_tunnel set to True the auth token is required to keep the tunnel alive.
# Create account at ngrok.com and paste the token in this file.
ngrok_tunnel: false
ngrok_auth_token: 'auth_token'

# Login on Google Home app and configuration interface
auth_user: 'admin'
auth_pass: 'admin'
  
# Domoticz Settings:
Domoticz:
  ip: 'http://192.168.1.100'
  port: '8080'
  roomplan: '0'
  username: 'username'
  password: 'password'
  switchProtectionPass: '1234' #Set this to false if ask for pin function is not needed
  
# Google Assistant Settings:
ClientID: 'ADD_YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE'
ClientSecret: 'ADD_YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE'
Homegraph_API_Key: 'ADD_YOUR HOMEGRAPH_API_KEY_HERE'

## Stream camera to chromecast
Stream security camera to chromecast. Supports hls, dash, smooth streaming, Progressive MP4 urls. More info: https://developers.google.com/actions/smarthome/traits/camerastream#video-formats. You need a to convert your video url to one of above. Try with ffmpeg or with a surveillance software system. Try out http://shinobi.video.  
In domoticz you need to attach a switch to your camera (create a switch then in Settings/Camera, add the switch to the camera)

Example convert rtsp to hls or mp4 using ffmpeg:
```
ffmpeg -rtsp_transport tcp -i rtsp://admin:123456@192.168.0.218/live/ch1 \
  -acodec copy \
  -vcodec copy \
  -hls_wrap 40 \
  -flags -global_header \
  /var/www/html/cam/cam.m3u8
```
```
ffmpeg -rtsp_transport tcp -i rtsp://admin:123456@192.168.0.218/live/ch1 \
  -c:a aac \
  -vcodec copy \
  -f mp4 \
  -y \
  -flags -global_header \
  /var/www/html/cam/cam.mp4
```   
In config:
```python
Camera_Stream:
  Enabled: false
  Cameras:
    Idx:
      - '123'
      - '234'
      - '345'
    Camera_URL:
      - 'http://your.web.server/cam/cam.m3u8'
      - 'https://content.jwplatform.com/manifests/yp34SRmf.m3u8'
      - 'http://user:password@192.168.1.102:8080/mp4/cctv/camera2/s.mp4'
```

## Device Settings
Nicknames, rooms and ack can be set in the Domoticz user interface. Simply put the device configuration in the device description, in a section between 'voicecontrol' tags like:
```
<voicecontrol>
nicknames = Kitchen Blind One, Left Blind, Blue Blind
room = Kitchen
ack = True
</voicecontrol>
```
Other parts of the description are ignored, so you can still leave other useful descriptions.
Every variable should be on a separate line.
If there is no such configuration in the Domoticz device it will still try the config.py.
